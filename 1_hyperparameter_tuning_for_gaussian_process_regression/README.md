# Blog post *Hyperparameter tuning via Maximum Likelihood estimation for Gaussian process regression*

Here, you find supplementary material accomapanying the blog post [*Hyperparameter tuning via Maximum Likelihood estimation for Gaussian process regression*](url), which was published on my personal website. 

Namely, we provide:
- the jupyter notebook `notebook.ipynb` that the post is based on.
- source code for the python package `gp_regression`â€”a simple object-oriented implementation
of Gaussian Process regression that is used in the blog. 

The package provides functionality for:
 - hyperparameter optimization
 - sampling from the prior or posterior distribution
 - performing predictions for unknown outputs
 - as well as several methods for visualization purposes.

The package also comes with unittests and is well-documented via docstrings.
If you are interested in installing `gp_regression`, please follow the detailed instructions below.


### Installation of gp_regression
- clone repo
- create conda env
- use dependencies from yaml (what abt jupyter)
- build package
git clone https://github.com/chris-hoffmann/blog_posts.git
