# Supplementary material for published blog posts

This repository contains supplementary material related to my blog posts, which are published on
my [personal website](https://www.chris-hoffmann.ml/blog).

Each post comes with a dedicated folder that contains the notebook on which the 
post is based and often additional content as well.

So far, we have covered the following topics:
 1. [*Hyperparameter tuning via Maximum Likelihood estimation for Gaussian process regression*](url)
